# password-card
With this program you can generate and use password cards.   
With the help of these cards and a password of your choice, the program will generate your password.
Unlike in the normal case, you do not have to remember the password,   
you only need to remember your "word" and the **password_card.txt** and/or **password_card.pdf** file.

## Using the program without an existing password card
First you will be asked if you already have a password card or if you want the program to create one for you.
If you need a password card, enter the letter **y** in the console.  
Now you will be asked for a "word". When you have thought of one, enter it into the console.    
Note, however, that it consists only of capital letters. Now your password will be displayed in the console.
**You should remember your phrase and keep the generated password card, because this is the key to your password.**   
(You can find the password card in the folder with the Python code as .pdf and .txt file. The text file is used for reading into the Python program. The PDF file can be used for manual handling.)

## using the program with already existing password card and mnemonic
First you will be asked if you already have a password card or if you want the program to create one for you.
If you don't need a password card anymore, move your already existing **password_card.txt file** into the folder with the python code, type the letter **n** into the console.  
Now you will be asked for your "word" you have to remember to. Enter it into the console as well, but note that it only consists of capital letters.   
Now your password will be displayed in the console.
